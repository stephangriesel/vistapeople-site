message1: At Cape People & Cognitive Technologies in Amsterdam, we aimed to grow
  our team without being constrained by geography. In our search to enhance our
  capabilities, we found a qualified candidate in South Africa. To support this
  expansion of our team, we needed a reliable partner to help with
  administrative tasks and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
  Vista People has played a key role in facilitating our remote workforce. After
  our initial discussions, Vista organized the necessary arrangements to support
  our operations effectively. Having a trusted partner to navigate evolving
  markets has made the process of building a remote team more manageable and
  efficient.
