message1: We were looking for ways to build our team, but at a lower cost than
  we had incurred in the past, although having a quality hard working person was
  very important. A team member came up with the idea of finding and employing a
  suitable candidate, based in South Africa. This would result in lower employee
  costs and an increased margin. Vista was able to introduce us to a recruiting
  partner that found a suitable candidate. We signed our service agreement with
  Vista, paid our deposit and Vista organised the rest. We achieved success in
  finding the right candidate and feel secure in knowing Vista takes care of all
  the compliance.
